                    <h2>Why The ICT Field Suits Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I like web development, this field of engineering allows products to be developed relatively
                        quickly, it allows tools to be made and distributed cheaply to enrich the lives of everyone who owns a computer
                        and to allow the developer(s) to make living in the process. The ideas I have for software I
                        want to develop, and my passion for programming, that is my motivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like the simplicity and reliability offered by HTML with javascript, it allows
                        sophiscticated online tools to be made relatively easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since my first program in 2018 I have enjoyed programming. I have written many kinds of
                        programs in many languages, of which:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>BASIC,</li>
                        <li>C,</li>
                        <li>React,</li>
                        <li>React Native,</li>
                        <li>AutoHotKey,</li>
                        <li>Processing,</li>
                        <li>Arduino,</li>
                        <li>Unity,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        and of course
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML,</li>
                        <li>CSS,</li>
                        <li>and Javascript.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>My Biggest Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        My biggest project yet is the development of a tool that can generate a personal planning
                        based on a to do list and an agenda. I started developing it in React Native over two years ago. However I started
                        again half a year ago, this time I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hundreds of hours I have
                        spent on it already, and the first release is getting into view. All main features work, but
                        it is not that user friendly yet. I recently converted the codebase to use modules instead of 'loose' scripts.
