                    <p>
                        I am Boaz Crezee, a 21 years old amateur programmer, runner, and christian from Vlissingen.
                        As
                        far as I can remember I have been interested by, thinking about, developing, drawing, and or
                        building intricate systems, machines, and devices.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Running</h3>
                    <p>I like running, from around 2014 to 2023 I have been part of an Athletics club. Zeeland is
                        the
                        perfect place to run thanks to its flat terrain and beautiful coastline.</p>
                    <p>I've run Zeeland's coastal marathon in 2021 and in 2022, it is a 42-kilometer run from the
                        city of Burgh-Haemstede in Schouwen-Duiveland to the village Zoutelande in Walcheren. the
                        last 10
                        kilometers are tough, yet running a marathon is the experience of a lifetime.</p>

                    <h3>YouTube</h3>
                    <p>I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SP4CEBAR/videos">YouTube channel</a> where I show
                        and explain electrical systems in 3D sandbox games
                        like Minecraft and Survivalcraft. Survivalcraft is about as old as Minecraft, but it has
                        more powerful electrical components. With them, I have made mechanical printers, text
                        screens, and smart mechanical machines. I have also made basic tutorials for those components, these are my most popular videos.</p>

                    <h3>Games</h3>
                    <p>I like playing games, of which:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minecraft,</li>
                        <li>Kerbal Space Program,</li>
                        <li>and Bloons TD 6.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Faith</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since 2015 I am a devout Christian. Christianity provides an answer for a problem all of
                        humanity has: We naturally do things we know are evil. Everyone has at least once broken Gods law and
                        there is nothing we can do about it anymore. Unless God intervened, and He did, He sent Jesus Christ to live life without
                        doing anything evil, Jesus then he died one of the worst deaths imaginable. However, three days after He was buried, something remarkable happened: He rose
                        from the dead! Through this, Jesus took the heavy punishment for our sins upon Himself so that anyone who turns from their sins can be completely forgiven.
